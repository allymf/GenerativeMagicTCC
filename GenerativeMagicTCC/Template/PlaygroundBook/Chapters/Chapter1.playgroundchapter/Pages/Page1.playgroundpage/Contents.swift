 Hi, I'm **Alysson**. That's a picture of myself on the right. 👉🏼
 
 I'm a research intern at **Apple Developer Academy - IFCE**, and undergraduate of **Digital Media and Systems** at **Universidade Federal do Ceará**.
 
 ### Prepared for storytime?
 
 Many people tend to think that “*Art is for artist*”. I was very frustrated with this concept, being, among other things, a coder.🙇🏻‍♂️
 
 But art is about diversity, in every single sense of the word.🎨🖌
 
 During a very dark period of my life, I really felt the need to express my feelings. I spent a lot of time looking for a venue to do so artistically. But I couldn't find one that fit my abilities. I felt the urge to use them in a more creative way.🤔
 
 Last year, I attend a course at my university and there discovered the Generative Art and it blew my mind. 🤯🤩
 
 Throughout this playground I would like to show you how magical it is.
