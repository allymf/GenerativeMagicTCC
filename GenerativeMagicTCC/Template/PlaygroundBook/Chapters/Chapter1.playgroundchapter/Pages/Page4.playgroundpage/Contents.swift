 I hope you could see the magic in **Generative Art** and all it's potencials.🧙🏼‍♂️
 
 There are great tools for generative art out there, e.g. Processing and Isadora. But now it's up to you to explore.😉
 
 - Note:
 This Playground Book cover, the filtered picture of myself, and the ASCII art lettering were all made using processes of generative art.
 
 - Note:
 The cover and the filtered image were solely created by me, using Processing.💪🏼
